HOW TO GET RICH. Valuable Money-Making Secrets.


  These recipes have sold for five dollars each, and have been the
  foundations of many good-sized fortunes.

This collection of recipes and formulas for making various articles
which are in constant use in every household are, for the most part,
articles upon which very large profits are made, both by manufacturers
and dealers; some things, which cost but two or three cents to make,
being retailed for as much as twenty-five cents. We point out to you
the proper method to be pursued in the manufacture of these various
articles, and expect you to use your own judgment and discretion in the
matter of putting them up for market, and exposing them for sale. The
goods, when ready for market, may be sold either direct to consumers at
retail, or to store-keepers at wholesale. Those who adopt the former
method may canvass from house to house, or establish a store and
sell therefrom. The various ingredients required to compound all the
different articles for which recipes are here given may be purchased
at wholesale drug and grocery stores in any of the large cities. Large
fortunes have been made upon the manufacture of single articles, for
which recipes are here given, and there is no reason why any one
may not acquire a competency in the same way, providing he has the
necessary push and sagacity. Here is an opportunity to be your own
manufacturer, your own wholesaler and your own retailer. Given these
advantages, you may undersell those in the ordinary channels of trade,
and still make handsome profits; and we trust that the information
herein contained may be the means of starting many a poor person toward
making a fortune or a good income.

Black Ink.--Ink, like soap, is something everybody uses, and few people
realize that thousands of barrels of it are made and sold.

Recipe for making the best and most durable black writing ink, as used
by the leading penmen of the United States and Canada.

To 2 gallons of strong decoction of logwood, well strained, add 1-1/2
lbs. blue galls in coarse powder, 6 ounces sulphate of iron, 1 oz.
acetate of copper, 6 oz. of pulverized sugar, and 8 oz. of gum arabic;
set the above on the fire until it begins to boil, strain, and then
set it away until it has acquired the desired blackness. The strong
“decoction of logwood” is made by boiling; use soft water, into which
put two ounces of logwood; strain after taking from the fire.

The above ink properly made, according to the above directions, is
unsurpassed for elegant writing of any kind. It flows freely from the
pen, turns to a deep black after writing, and does not fade. Records
written with it fifty years ago are as legible as the day they were put
upon the paper.

Fig Candy.--Take 1 pound of sugar and 1 pint of water; set over a slow
fire. When done, add a few drops of vinegar and a lump of butter, and
pour into pans in which split figs are laid.

Red Sealing Wax.--Purchase 4 lbs. shellac, 1-1/2 lbs. venice
turpentine, 3 lbs. finest cinnabar and 4 oz. venetian; mix the whole
well together, and melt over a very slow fire. Pour it on a thick,
smooth glass, or any other flat, smooth surface, and make it into 3, 6
or 10 sticks.

Silver Ink.--Mix 1 oz. of the finest pewter or block tin in shavings
with 2 oz. quicksilver till all becomes fluid; then add to it
sufficient gum arabic water to produce the proper consistency.

Yellow Ink.--A little alum added to saffron, in soft, hot water, makes
a beautiful yellow ink.

Mucilage for Labels.--Dextrine, 2 ounces; glycerine, 1 drachm; alcohol,
1 ounce; water, 6 ounces.

The Celebrated Chemical Compound.--Take one pint of alcohol, 2 gills
nitrous spirits ether, 2 oz. bicromate potash, 2 oz. powdered cinnamon,
2 oz. aqua fortis. Mix all the above together and let it stand
twenty-four hours and it is fit for use. Bottle in ounce vials, and
sell for 25 cents. To extract grease stains, etc., from cloth, saturate
with cold water, dip a sponge in the liquid and apply it, and repeat if
necessary, and wash off with cold water.

Gold Ink.--Two parts mosaic, 1 part gum arabic (by measure); mix with
soft water until reduced to a proper condition.

Green Ink.--Powder 1 ounce verdigris, and put it in 1 quart of vinegar;
after it has stood two or three days, strain off the liquid.

Blue Ink.--Two oz. Chinese blue, 3/4 oz. pure oxolid acid, 1 oz.
powdered gum arabic, 6 pints distilled soft water; mix well and then
strain.

Purple Ink.--Eight parts logwood in 64 parts soft water, by measure,
boil down to one-half, then strain and add one part chloride of tin.

Imitation Gold.--Sixteen parts platina, seven parts copper, one part
zinc. Put in a covered crucible, with powdered charcoal, and melt
together till the whole forms one mass, and are thoroughly incorporated
together. Or, take 4 oz. platina, 3 oz. silver, 1 oz. copper.

Imitation Silver.--Eleven ounces refined nickel, two ounces metallic
bismuth. Melt the compositions together three times, and pour them
out in ley. The third time, when melting, add two ounces pure silver.
Or take one-quarter ounce copper, one ounce bismuth, two ounces
saltpetre, two ounces common salt, one ounce arsenic, one ounce potash,
two ounces brass, and three ounces pure silver. Melt all together in a
crucible.

Florida Water.--Half pint proof spirits, two drachms oil lemon, half
drachm oil rosemary. Mix.

Freckle Lotion.--Muriate of ammonia, one drachm; cologne water, two
drachms; distilled water, seven ounces; mix and use as a wash. It
contains nothing injurious.

Windsor Soap.--This is made with lard. In France they use lard, with
a portion of olive or bleached palm oil. It is made with one part of
olive oil to nine of tallow; but a greater part of what is sold is only
curd (tallow) soap, and scented with oil of caraway and bergamot. The
brown is colored with burnt sugar or umber.

To Make Maple Sugar without Maple Trees.--Though the secret I am about
to reveal may seem very simple (when explained), I believe there are
few who would discover it of their own accord. The value of the maple
sugar crop is considerable, and there is ready sale for all that can be
made. I was led by curiosity to boil down a little butternut sap, one
time, with an equal quantity of maple sap, and the result was, a sugar
which I could not distinguish from pure maple. I experimented further
and found that if a little common (cane) sugar was added to the sap of
the butternut, it would do as well as an addition of maple sap. I found
that the sap of birch and several other trees would also make, when
a very little cane sugar was added, a sugar which in looks and taste
exactly resembled maple. To be able to make “maple” sugar from trees
not heretofore deemed valuable for the purpose is just so much clear
profit.

Traveller’s Ink.--White blotting paper is saturated with aniline black,
and several sheets are pasted together so as to form a thick pad. When
required for use a small piece is torn off and covered with a little
water. The black liquid which dissolves out is a good writing ink. A
square inch of paper will produce enough ink to last a considerable
writing, and a few pads would be all that an exploring party need carry
with them. As water is always available the ink is readily made. This
is a perfectly original and new recipe. Any enterprising man can make a
large income out of its manufacture.

Violet Ink.--1 oz. best violet aniline; dissolve it in one gill of
hot alcohol, stir, and when thoroughly dissolved add one gallon of
boiling hot water; dissolve in the hot water 1-1/2 oz. white gum
arabic. This will make the most rich and beautiful ink of this color
in existence; will not fade or corrode steel pens, and is not injured
by freezing. An addition of 1 lb. of sugar and 1/2 lb. glycerine will
make an excellent copying ink. This ink is usually sold at $2 per pint
bottle, $1 for half pint and 50 cents for gill bottle. It is worth an
enterprising man or woman $1,000. Do not bury it--use it and make money
out of it.

New York Barber’s Star Hair Oil.--Castor oil, 6-1/2 pints, alcohol,
1-1/2 pints, oil of citronella, 1/2 ounce, lavender, 1/4 ounce. Mix
well, put in 4-ounce bottles; retail at 25 cents each.

Furniture Polish.--Equal parts sweet oil and vinegar, and a pint of gum
arabic finely powdered. Shake the bottle and apply with a rag. It will
make furniture look as good as new.

Artificial Gold.--This is a new metallic alloy which is now very
extensively used in France as a substitute for gold. Pure copper, one
hundred parts; zinc, or, preferably, tin, seventeen parts; magnesia,
six parts; sal-ammoniac, three-sixths parts; quick-lime, one-eighth
part; tartar of commerce, nine parts, are mixed as follows: The copper
is first melted, and the magnesia, sal-ammoniac, lime and tartar are
then added separately, and by degrees, in the form of powder; the
whole is now briskly stirred for about half an hour, so as to mix
thoroughly; and when the zinc is added in small grains by throwing it
on the surface, and stirring till it is entirely fused, the crucible is
then covered, and the fusion maintained for about thirty-five minutes.
The surface is then skimmed, and the alloy is ready for casting. It
has a fine grain, is malleable, and takes a splendid polish. It does
not corrode readily, and for many purposes is an excellent substitute
for gold. When tarnished, its brilliancy can be restored by a little
acidulated water. If tin be employed instead of zinc, the alloy will
be more brilliant. It is very much used in France, and must ultimately
attain equal popularity here.

Baking Powder.--The following receipt is the same as used in the
preparation of the standard baking powders of the day, and if put up
attractively will sell readily at the usual prices. Take 1 pound of
_tartaric_ acid in _crystals_, 1-1/2 pounds of bi-carbonate of soda and
1-1/2 pounds of potato starch. Each must be powdered separately, well
dried by slow heat, well mixed through a sieve. Pack hard in tinfoil,
tin or paper glazed on the outside. The tartaric acid and bi-carbonate
of soda can, of course, be bought cheaper of wholesale druggists than
you can make them, unless you are doing things on a very large scale,
but potato starch any one can make; it is only necessary to peel the
potatoes and to grate them up fine into vessels of water, to let them
settle, pour off the water and make the settlings into balls, and to
dry them. With these directions any one can make as good a baking
powder as is sold anywhere; if he wants to make it very cheap, he can
take _cream of tartar_ and common washing (carbonate of) soda, instead
of the articles named in the recipe, but this would be advisable only
where customers insist on excessively low prices in preference to
quality of goods.

Babbit’s Premium Soap.--Five gallons of strong lye, five gallons of
water, five pounds of tallow, two pounds of sal soda, half a pound of
rosin, one pint salt, one pint washing fluid. Let this water boil, then
put in the articles, and boil half an hour. Stir it well while boiling,
and then run it into moulds: it will be ready for use as soon as cold.
The above is for 100 pounds of soap.

Royal Washing Powder.--Mix any quantity of soda ash with an equal
quantity of carbonate of soda--ordinary soda--crushed into coarse
grains. Have a thin solution of glue, or decoction of linseed oil
ready, into which pour the soda until quite thick. Spread it out on
boards in a warm apartment to dry. As soon as dry shake up well so that
it will pack easily into nice, square packages. Label neatly. Pound
packages cost 7 cents, retail for 25 cents.

Patent Starch Polish.--Take common dry potato or wheat starch,
sufficient to make a pint of starch when boiled. When boiled add
one-half drachm spermaceti, and one-half drachm of white wax, then use
it as common starch, only using the iron as hot as possible.

Invisible Ink.--Sulphuric acid 1 part, water 20 parts; mix together and
write with a quill pen, which writing can only be read after heating it.

Fine Peppermint Lozenges.--Best powdered white sugar, 7 pounds; pure
starch, 1 pound; oil of peppermint to flavor. Mix with mucilage.

India Ink.--Ivory black ground into powder, make into a paste with
a few drops of essence of musk, and one half as much essence of
ambergris, and then form into cakes.

To Preserve Flowers in Water.--Mix a little carbonate of soda in the
water, and it will keep the flowers a fortnight.

Ginger Lozenges.--Mix with the white of eggs four ounces of powdered
ginger, two pounds of white sugar, and one pound of starch.

To Restore the Color of Black Kid Boots.--Take a small quantity of good
black ink, mix it with the white of an egg, and apply it to the boots
with a soft sponge.

Color for Wicker Baskets, or any small Articles of the Kind.--Dissolve
one stick of black sealing-wax and one stick of red in two ounces of
spirits of wine. Lay it on with a small brush.

To Remove Stains from Books.--To remove ink-spots, apply a solution of
oxalic, citric, or tartaric acid. To remove spots of grease, wax, oil,
or fat, wash the injured part with either, and place it between white
blotting-paper. Then, with a hot iron, press above the part stained.

To Clean Black Veils.--Pass them through a warm liquor of bullock’s
gall and water; rinse in cold water; then take a small piece of glue,
pour boiling water on it, and pass the veil through it; clap it, and
frame to dry. Instead of framing, it may be fastened with drawing-pins
closely fixed upon a very clean paste or drawing-board.

To Clean a Marble Chimney Piece.--If the marble is white, procure
half a pound of pearlash, one pound of whiting, and half a pound of
soft soap; boil all these ingredients together until they attain the
consistence of a thick paste. When nearly cold, lay it upon the marble,
and let it remain on it for at least twenty-four hours. Wash it off
with soft water, and polish with linen rags. Spirits of turpentine is
excellent for cleaning black marble.

Oil Stains in Silk and other Fabrics.--Benzine is most effectual, not
only for silk, but for any other material whatever. It can be procured
from any druggist. By simply covering both sides of greased silk
with magnesia, and allowing it to remain for a few hours, the oil is
absorbed by the powder. Should the first application be insufficient,
it may be repeated, and even rubbed in with the hand. Should the silk
be Tussah or Indian silk, it will wash.

Scarlet Ink.--Dissolve 1 oz. garancine of the best quality in 1 oz.
liquor ammonia; add 1 pint soft cold water distilled; mix together in a
mortar, filter and dissolve in it 1/2 oz. of gum arabic.

Luminous Ink.--Shines in the dark--Phosphorous, one-half drachm, oil
cinnamon, one-half oz., mix in a vial, cork tightly, heat it slowly
until mixed. A letter written with this ink can only be read in a dark
room, when the writing will have the appearance of fire.

Brown Ink.--Take 4 parts powdered catechu and put it in 6 parts soft
water; let it stand for half a day, shaking occasionally, then strain,
and to bring it to the proper consistency, add sufficient of a solution
of bichromate of potash, 1 part in 16 of water, all by measure.

Ink Powder.--One pound of nutgall, 7 ounces copperas, 7 ounces gum
arabic: this amount of ink powder will make one gallon of good black
ink; to prevent it from moulding, powder two or three cloves and mix
with each pound of powder.

Excelsior Hair Oil.--One gallon cologne spirits 90 per cent. proof, add
of the oil of lemon, orange and bergamot, each a spoonful, add also of
the extract of vanilla 40 drops, shake until the oils are cut up, then
add one and a half pints of soft water.

Commercial Writing Ink.--Galls, 1 ounce; gum, 1/2 ounce; cloves, 1/2
ounce; sulphate of iron, 1/2 ounce; water, 8 ounces. Digest by frequent
shaking until it has sufficient color. This is a good durable ink and
will bear diluting.

Indelible Ink.--For marking linen without preparation. Nitrate of
silver, 1-1/2 oz., dissolve in 6 oz. of liquor ammonia fortis, archil
for coloring, 1 oz. Gum mucilage, 12 ounces. The best extant.

Bristol’s Tooth Powder.--Prepared chalk, 1 pound; castile soap, 1/2
pound; powdered yellow bark, 2 ounces; powdered gum myrrh, 2 ounces;
powdered loaf sugar, 2 ounces; powdered orris, 2 ounces. Mix well,
after having first pulverized the castile.

Cold Cream.--One pound of lard, three ounces of spermaceti. Melt with a
gentle heat, and when cooling stir in orange-flower water, one ounce,
essence of lavender, twenty-six drops.

To Make Paint for One Cent a Pound.--To one gallon of soft hot water
add four pounds sulphate of zinc (crude). Let it dissolve perfectly,
and a sediment will settle at the bottom. Turn the clear solution into
another vessel. To one gallon of paint (lead and oil), mix one gallon
of the compound. Stir into it the paint slowly for ten or fifteen
minutes, and the compound and the paint will perfectly combine. If too
thick, thin it with turpentine. This receipt has been sold to painters
as high as $100 for the privilege to use the same in their business.

Almond Cream.--(There is nothing equal to this cream for softening and
whitening the hands.) Mix honey, almond meal and olive oil into a paste
to be used after washing with soap. Castile soap is best for use; it
will cure a scratch, or cut, and prevents any spot.

Cream of Roses.--Take one teacupful of rose water, as much
sub-carbonate of potash as will lie on a shilling, and half an ounce of
oil of sweet almonds. Let all be well shaken together until it becomes
thoroughly mixed, which will take some time. This is one of the best
face washes made, and is entirely harmless.

Excellent Pomade.--Three ounces of olive oil, three-quarters of a
drachm of the oil of almonds, two drachms of palm oil, half an ounce of
white wax, a quarter of a pound of lard, and three-quarters of a drachm
of the essence of bergamot. This pomade is excellent for strengthening
the hair, promoting the growth of whiskers and moustaches, and
preventing baldness.

Superior Cologne Water.--Alcohol, one gallon; add oil of cloves, lemon,
nutmeg and bergamot, each one drachm; oil neroli, three and a half
drachms; seven drops of oils of rosemary, lavender and cassia; half
a pint of spirits of nitre; half a pint of elder-flower water. Let it
stand a day or two, then take a colander and at the bottom lay a piece
of white cloth, and fill it up, one-fourth of white sand, and filter
through it.

Family Salve.--Take the root of the yellow dock and dandelion, equal
parts; add good proportion of celandine and plantain. Extract the
juices by steeping or pressing. Strain carefully, and simmer the liquid
with sweet cream or fresh butter and mutton tallow, or sweet oil and
mutton tallow. Simmer together until no appearance of the liquid
remains. Before it is quite cold, put it into boxes. This is one of the
most soothing and healing preparations for burns, scalds, cuts, and
sores of every description.

Japanese Cement.--Immediately mix the best powdered rice with a little
cold water, then gradually add boiling water until a proper consistency
is acquired, being particularly careful to keep it well stirred all the
time; lastly, it must be boiled for a minute in a clean saucepan or
earthern pipkin. This glue is beautifully white and almost transparent,
for which reason it is well adapted for fancy paper work, which
requires a strong and colorless cement.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
